# Wine Classification with Scikit-Learn
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation and comparison of three popular classification algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) on the Wine dataset using the Scikit-Learn library.

## Dataset
The Wine dataset is a classic dataset widely used in machine learning. It consists of 178 samples with 13 features, representing different chemical analyses of wines. The dataset is divided into three classes, indicating three different types of wines. The goal is to classify the wines correctly based on their chemical composition.

## Dependencies
To run the notebook and reproduce the results, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python (version 3.x)
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-Learn

## Files
SVM-KNN-GNB.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the implementation and comparison of SVM, KNN, and GNB classifiers on the Wine dataset.
wine.data: The dataset file in CSV format. It contains the wine samples and their corresponding labels.

## Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
Open a command prompt or terminal and navigate to the repository directory.
Launch Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Your web browser should open the Jupyter Notebook interface. Click on the SVM-KNN-GNB.ipynb file to open it.
Follow the instructions and execute the code cells in the notebook to run the classifiers and observe the results.
Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different parameters to further explore the classifiers' behavior.

## Results and Discussion
The notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of SVM, KNN, and GNB classifiers on the Wine dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result visualization. The results are presented in the form of accuracy scores and confusion matrices, allowing you to compare the performance of each classifier.

You can analyze the results and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of each classifier for this particular dataset. Additionally, you can further improve the models' performance by tuning hyperparameters or experimenting with other algorithms.
